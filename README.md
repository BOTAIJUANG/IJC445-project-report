# IJC445 Project Repository

This repository contains the R code and visualisation outputs used in the IJC445 Data Visualisation course project.  
This project explores patterns in air pollution in London by analysing PM2.5 and NO₂ concentrations from multiple monitoring stations, and demonstrates how data visualisation techniques can be used to communicate environmental data effectively.

## Data
- Air pollution data: PM2.5 and NO₂ measurements from four London monitoring stations  
  - Greenwich (Westhorne Avenue)  
  - Harlington  
  - Westminster  
  - Elizabeth Bridge  

## How to run

The visual analysis was carried out in R.  
All scripts for data loading, preprocessing, and figure generation are stored in the `code` folder.  
To reproduce the visualisations, set the working directory to the data folder, open the script in R or RStudio, and run it from top to bottom.  
The script will automatically generate and save all figures used in the report.

## Findings

The visualisations show clear temporal and spatial variations in air pollution levels across London.  
PM2.5 and NO₂ concentrations change throughout the day, with higher levels generally observed during rush hours.  
Differences between monitoring stations suggest that local traffic intensity and surrounding environments strongly influence pollution levels.  
The relationship between PM2.5 and NO₂ is more evident during peak periods, indicating that they may share similar emission sources, especially traffic-related activities.
